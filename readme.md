# Tetris

A tetris game built with canvas and redux!

[Demo](https://mattwaggs.github.io/tetris/)

### Controls

Arrow keys to move, space to hold, p to pause.


### Known Issues

 - Random does not seem random enough (generating next piece)
 - I dont know how scoring is actually supposed to work. This was a quick guess.
